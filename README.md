# da——2024

During my internship at the Peking University Institute for Computing and Digital Economy, I worked as a **Software Engineer Intern**, contributing to both front-end and back-end development.

**Front-End Development**: Led the development of a **React**-based AIGC web application using **TypeScript**, **Next.js**, and **Chakra UI**. Built 30+ reusable components from scratch, achieving 100% feature completion.

**Performance Optimization**: Optimized **Nginx** for load balancing and static file caching, reducing server response time by 50%. Configured dual ports for demo and development environments, enabling a team of 10 to efficiently test and deploy the application.

**Back-End Development**: Developed robust backend services using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. Optimized **MySQL** database performance through indexing and query tuning, leading to a 20% reduction in query execution time.

**API Integration**: Implemented efficient data fetching and interaction using Axios and seamlessly integrated the application with LLM via **OpenAI** API.

Here's a **demo video**:
